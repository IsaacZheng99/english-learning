# Part2&3 人物类

1. 见过一次且想了解更多的人

**Describe a person you only met once and want to know more about**
**You should say:**

- **Who he/she is**
- **When you met him/her**
- **Why you want to know more about him/her**

**And explain how you feel about him/her**

The person I would like to talk about today is a professor who taught me during my sophomore year at college. And I met her in a very tough course which is about computer composition principles.

In my opinion, she is a very responsible and attentive teacher who can explain all the knowledge points in this difficult course very clearly. She also took a lot of time between classes to answer our questions. In Chinese universities, teachers always put a lot of energy into their research, and may not care that much about teaching. But Professor Xu is not like this. She will prepare every class carefully, and will do her best to help us in the experimental class. So I feel very lucky to have met such a teacher. And in the end I also got a good grade in this class. As for why I want to get to know her better, it is because she has been teaching for almost thirty years and is a very experienced teacher. And I also have a certain yearning for the profession of a teacher, and maybe I will work hard in this direction in the future. So I want to learn from her how to teach efficiently and with high quality.

**How do people make friends in China?**

Well, I think there are absolutely a lot of ways to make friends. but the most common one might be taking part in some activities or introduced by a friend that they have in common. So the both sides will have the opportunity to chat with each other and find some common interests.

**On what occasions do people like to make friends?**

Well, definitely at parties, I mean, the whole point of going to a party is to have fun, to meet new friends. You are supposed to mingle at parties. With food and drinks, people loosen up and are readier to socialize.

I think people also like to make friends on travels, especially when traveling in a foreign country. Visitors especially whose who travel solo are happy to make friends with other travelers, like they can explore things together and share experiences. 

**Is it important to have the same hobbies and interests when making friends?**

Well, I believe yes, because when you have shared hobbies and interests, then you'll have a lot to talk about, and you can take part in some activities together and have fun together.

It is super important. People with the same hobbies and interests are drawn to each other naturally, they just click with each other. Because friends are people you enjoy spending time with, I mean, when you have the same hobbies and interests, there’s so much to talk about, you can talk all day long without getting bored. You’d always love to have someone who gets you and speaks your language.

Otherwise, I don’t think a friendship will ever happen in the first place, it’d be very awkward to pretend to be interested in something that someone talks about that actually puts you to sleep. You’d wanna get out of there as fast as possible.

**What qualities make true friends?**

True friends definitely support each other during difficult times. As they always say, a friend in need is a friend indeed. I mean, when you are successful and having it good, you are surrounded by people who call themselves your friends but when you fail most of them will leave. True friends will always be there for you, through ups and downs.

Another thing life has taught me is that true friends know boundaries. They don’t feel the need to pry into your life. They let you come to them, open up to them, instead of forcing you to share.

2. 对社会有贡献的人

**Describe a person who contributes to the society**

**You should say:**

- **Who this person is**
- **How you knew him/her**
- **What type of work he/she does**

**And explain why you think he/she contributes to the society**

When talking about this topic, the first one that comes to my mind must be Elon Musk. I knew him from my class in which my teacher asked us to listen to his speech. Though he was world-renowned, I knew nothing about him before that class, because I was indifferent to business news. From his talk, I began to know that he was a go- getter.

He is the founder of Space X, Tesla, and Paypal which are influential in the world. He said that when he wanted to launch a rocket to Mars, no one believed that he could make it. He was in massive debt because of his dream, but he never gave up. When I heard his words, I was touched by his strong willpower.

In terms of reasons why he contributes to society, first, his companies **provide millions of job opportunities** in various countries. It would be serious if many people couldn’t find jobs, so suppose this is a big contribution of him. Second, the electronic cars he developed are more environment-friendly. As these cars will not **burn fossil fuels**, the green gases they produce could be less, which can help to relieve that global warming. Therefore, the environment could be protected better.

**What jobs are well-paid?**

Some jobs that require knowledge or skill are well-paid. For example, programmers, doctors and professors. They have invested a lot of time and effort in the pre-learning phase, so they deserve to earn high salaries. But there are some professions, such as actors and singers, who are also well paid because people like their face or voice.

**What are the impacts of the epidemic on the work environment?**

The epidemic has made it difficult for people to communicate with each other. Unable to meet in person, many meetings have to be online. It is difficult for people to feel each other's tone and emotions through screens or text. 

People have become increasingly dependent on computers, which have become our mobile studios. We can start working from anywhere in the house.

**Do you think younger people should be lower-paid than older people?**

I think the qualities required for the job are something to consider. For example, some jobs require enough experience, so older people may have a  wealth of experience and be able to make quick decisions and solve problems depending on the situation, and they should also be paid more. But for other physically demanding jobs, young people may perform better in this area.

**What kinds of jobs deserve higher salaries in the future?**

I think that in the future jobs that require knowledge, skills and experience will be better paid. This is due to the fact that repetitive work in an assembly line can be replaced by machines wherever possible. Knowledge, skills and experience take time and effort to learn and develop. Therefore, they deserve to be paid more for the work they put in upfront.

3. 社交媒体上常刷的人

**Describe a person who you follow on social media**

**You should say:** 

- **Who he/she is**
- **How you knew him/her**
- **What he/she posts on social media**

**And explain why you follow him/her on social media**

The person I want to talk about is Elon Musk. I met him in a class where the teacher gave us his lecture. From his conversations, I learned that he is thought to be very imaginative and passionate. After class, I found him on social media and followed him.
Then I learned that he was the founder of several large companies. And he often makes some remarks on social media that may not be understood by ordinary people. He once said he wanted to launch a rocket to Mars, and no one believed it at the time, and many thought he was fanciful. But in the end he succeeded, and I was also impressed by his strong willpower.
As for why I follow him on social media, it's because I think creativity and imagination and willpower are things I'm missing today, and by following him, I've been able to learn a little bit of that quality from him.
You know, he's very ambitious to do something no one else has ever imagined. Launch rockets to Mars and build commercial supersonic aircraft. These are very imaginative things. Therefore, in my mind he is a very creative person, and I will learn from him.

**What can people do on social media?**

Well, first of all I think the most common is that people will share some of their personal life on social media, such as photos of travel or food, to express their happiness. Also, comment on some news or things shared by others.

 Second, through social media, people are able to get the latest news and follow fashion trend.

 Last but not least, People can learn a lot of new things from social media. In China, there are many bloggers who are professionals in a certain field, such as medicine, natural science and so on. They are able to share a lot of expertise with people.

**Do you think older people and younger people will use the same kind of social media software?**

I think the answer is in the middle. When it comes to the social media software which is used for chatting, there is no discrepancy between the elderly and the young. In China, most of people will utilize Wechat for contact owing to its convenience regardless of their age. 

However when using some complex social media software such as photoshop, teenagers have the competence to acclimatize themselves to use it, but the elder can’t. So it depends on different situation.

**Do older people spend much time on social media?**

I would say yes. Today, with the rapid development of social media, related software is becoming more and more convenient, and it can be easily used by older people. Especially for those who are retired. They have plenty of time to chat with old friends, and in many cases it is not easy for them to meet face to face. So chatting through social media becomes their first choice.

**Are non-social media like television and newspapers still useful?**

Frankly speaking yes. Some people think that social media will waste a lot of their time, so they are reluctant to use social media. In addition, due to the rapid development of information technology, some people are not able to use social media. For these people, TV and newspapers are still their better choices.

4. 想共度时光的人

**Describe someone you really like to spend time with**

**You should say:**

- **Who this person is**

- **How you knew him/her**

- **What you usually do together**

**And explain why you like to spend time with him/her**

When talking about this topic, the first one that comes to my mind must be my foreign teacher Austen. He is an American with blue eyes and short brown hair.

He was my oral English teacher, so I knew him in our first class. It was the first time that I had met a foreign teacher, which left me with a deep impression. He preferred to teach us vocabulary through playing games, which kindled English in me. 

We usually have lunch together. Unlike many teachers who want to keep distance from students, he invites us to have lunch with him on a regular basis, and he likes to care about many aspects of us. We can talk to him no matter what problems we have.
